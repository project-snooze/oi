### Intro
Lawyers charge between 10 and 80 hours to manage a client's will. The service typically involves making sure a certain amount of funds are transferred to the heir. By automating this service with Smart Contracts, we cut down the cost by a factor of 1000.
In addition to the transfer of crypto assets, After Me users can attach triggers such as publishing content that is permanently stored on-chain, effectively allowing users to leave behind an immutable record of their existence.

### Operating model
The user defines a will by assigning it a list of heirs, a waiting period and the total inheritance value. A one-and-done execution is triggered when the waiting period - between 14 and 180 days - is elapsed without the user signing in.  In addition to initializing the will, the web interface allows extending the wait period, editing the heirs (removing and/or modifying the assigned percentages), decreasing and increasing the value of the inheritance.
